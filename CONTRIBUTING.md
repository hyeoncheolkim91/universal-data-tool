# Things to do to contribute

* Thumbs up features or bugs you think are important!
* Create issues for features or bugs you find
* Solve UI bugs in existing issues
* Create react components for new UI features ("stories")
* Implement big features in draft PRs, taking breaks for feedback by messaging people on Slack
* Just fix a bunch of bugs and do a massive pull request with no description but all the tests pass and it looks pretty good so I guess it's fine

# Hhh'what do I need to know to get started
